Join is a query that is used to combine rows from two or more tables,
 It retrieves data from multiple tables.
 
Types of Joins:

Inner Joins (Simple Join)
Outer Joins
Left Outer Join (Left Join)
Right Outer Join (Right Join)
Full Outer Join (Full Join)
Equijoins
Self Joins
Cross Joins

77.What is the importance of SQL joins in database management?

joins play a crucial role in combining and accessing data from multiple tables, 
facilitating data integration, query flexibility, normalization, efficient retrieval, 
relationship representation, and data analysis in relational databases.

--78.What is the difference between WHERE and HAVING in SQL?

where Clause:

		1. It is used to perform filtration on individual rows.
		2. It is implemented in row operations.
		3. The WHERE clause fetches the specific data from 
			particular rows based on the specified condition.
		4. The WHERE clause does not allow to work with aggregate functions.
		5. The WHERE clause acts as a pre-filter
		6. We can use the WHERE clause with the SELECT, UPDATE, and DELETE statements.
		7. The GROUP BY clause comes after the WHERE clause.

Having Clause:

		1. It is used to perform filtration on groups.
		2. It is implemented in column operations.
		3. The HAVING clause first fetches the complete data. 
		4. It then separates them according to the given condition.
		5. The HAVING clause can work with aggregate functions.
		6. The HAVING clause acts as a post-filter.
		7. The HAVING clause can only use with the SELECT statement.
		8. The GROUP BY clause comes before the HAVING clause.


--79.What are the clauses in oracle SQL?

SELECT: The SELECT clause is used to specify the columns or 
expressions you want to retrieve from the database.

FROM: The FROM clause is used to specify the table or 
tables from which you want to retrieve data.

WHERE: The WHERE clause is used to filter rows based on specified conditions.

GROUP BY: The GROUP BY clause is used to group rows based on one or more columns. 
It is used in combination with aggregate functions (e.g., SUM, COUNT) 
to perform calculations on each group.

HAVING: The HAVING clause is used to filter groups based on conditions specified after the GROUP BY clause. 
It is similar to the WHERE clause but operates on grouped data.

ORDER BY: The ORDER BY clause is used to sort the result set based on one or more columns. 
It allows you to specify the sort order as ascending (ASC) or descending (DESC).

JOIN: The JOIN clause is used to combine rows from different tables based on specified join conditions. 
It allows you to retrieve data from multiple related tables in a single query.

UNION: The UNION clause is used to combine the result sets of two or 
more SELECT statements into a single result set. It removes duplicate rows by default.

DISTINCT: The DISTINCT clause is used to eliminate duplicate rows from the result set. 
It ensures that only unique values are returned for the specified columns.

LIMIT / FETCH: The LIMIT or FETCH clause is used to restrict the number of rows returned by a query. 
It is often used in conjunction with the ORDER BY clause.

--130.Difference between group by and order by clause.?

GROUP BY:

	GROUP BY is used to group rows based on one or more columns
	and perform aggregate functions on each group.

	GROUP BY is typically used in combination with aggregate functions like COUNT(), SUM(), AVG(), etc., 
	to generate summary reports or analyze data by groups.
 
 
ORDER BY:

	ORDER BY is used to sort the result set based on one or 
	more columns in ascending or descending order.

	It arranges the rows in a specific order based on the specified column(s) or expressions.

	ORDER BY is commonly used to present data in a specific order, 
	such as sorting names alphabetically, ordering by dates, or arranging values from highest to lowest.


--131.write a query to disply the first and last record from the employee table.?

select * from emp
order by emp_id
fetch first 1 row only;

select * from employee
order by employee_id desc
fetch first 1 row only; 

--132.can you create a table to give all contraints for one column.If not why?

NO,

	Oracle, like many other relational database management systems, has limitations on the number 
	and types of constraints that can be applied to a single column. 
	These limitations are in place to maintain the performance and efficiency of the database.

	While Oracle supports multiple constraints on a column, 
	there are certain combinations or excessive use of constraints that may not be accepted. 
	For example, it is not possible to have both a CHECK constraint and a FOREIGN KEY constraint on the same column in Oracle.
