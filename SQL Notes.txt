Data types:
	Number (P,S) P= Precison: total number of digits , S: fixed floating point numbers
	Number (P) maximum length of the precision is upto 38
	
	ex: create table test(
			sno number(5,2));
			when we use  (P,S) the total number of digits before decimal places to P-S
			
			
	Char: alpha numeric
	varchar: variable length alpha numeric data: ANSI standard(American National Standards Institute)
	varchar2: max size (oracle database only  )

Normalization : it is used to avoid the redendency.
any database which is satisfies upto the 3rd normalization form that implies good schema or database design

1NF :If a relation contains a composite or multi-valued attribute, it violates the first normal form.
A relation is in first normal form if every attribute in that relation is singled valued attribute. 

I/P: un normalized data
O/P: relation with  1NF

conditions:

- All the attribute values should be atomic (single value)
- attribute shiuld not have multivalues, composite
- all the attribute should be unique

ID   Name   Courses
------------------
1    A      c1, c2
2    E      c3
3    M      C2, c3 

the above example courses contain multiple values so it is not 1NF


ID   Name   Course
------------------
1    A       c1
1    A       c2
2    E       c3
3    M       c2
3    M       c3

above table is in 1NF as there is no multi-valued attribute 


2NF:
I/P: relation with 1NF
O/P: relation with 2NF

conditions:
	Relation should be in 1NF
	Relation should not have PARTIAL FUNCTIONAL DEPENDENCY.
	(the table should not contain two or more primary keys)
	
	
ex:

STUD_NO            COURSE_NO        COURSE_FEE
1                     C1                  1000
2                     C2                  1500
1                     C4                  2000
4                     C3                  1000
4                     C1                  1000
2                     C5                  2000

===============================================================================

       Table 1                    =                Table 2
STUD_NO            COURSE_NO      =   COURSE_NO                COURSE_FEE     
1                 C1              =    C1                        1000		
2                 C2              =    C2                        1500
1                 C4              =    C3                        1000
4                 C3              =    C4                        2000
4                 C1              =    C5                        2000        
2                 C5                      


Note â€“ 2NF tries to reduce the redundant data getting stored in memory.
For instance, if there are 100 students taking C1 course,
we dont need to store its Fee as 1000 for all the 100 records, 
instead once we can store it in the second table as the course fee for C1 is 1000.

===============================

create table as: it is reffer to create the table from the existing 
table by coping the columns of existing table.

ex: 
copy entire table:

	create table newtable 
	as (select * from old table)
	where condition;

copy selected columns:

	create table newtable 
	as (select col1,col2,col3,col4 from old table)
	where condition;

copy selected columns from multiple tables

	create table newtable
	as (select col1,col2,col3,coln from table1,table2,table3,table n)
	where condition;

=========================================================================
day 2:

constraints : are used to stop invalid data enter into our
database or table

constraints are 5 types:

Not null : it is does not accept null values,but it accept duplicate values,
it does not support at table level

unique : it is used to insert only unique(different) values into the rows. 
and it aloow null values. when we create a unique constraint oracle server will autoatically 
create a B-tree.

check : 
primary
foreign key
